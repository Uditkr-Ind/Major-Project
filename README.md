IoT-enabled Battery Health Prediction using Linear Regression Model in Machine Learning

Implemented Battery Lifecycle prediction using a voltage sensor to record data & transmit it using an IoT device. Trained a Machine Learning Model to monitor energy consumption & voltage drop and predict the remaining useful life of the battery. Tested for greater than 90% output accuracy.
